## My process

Write HTML code and insert QR image inside HTML. After that, I use SCSS for styling. I follow Mobile's first approach for better responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- grid
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

**HTML:** Understanding HTML is crucial as it forms the backbone of all web development.

**CSS:** Using CSS for styling has shown me the importance of maintaining a proper style guide for better organization and readability.

**Git:** Last but not least, learning Git has been essential for version control and collaborative development.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
